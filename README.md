Black Fennec is going to be an application that is able to manage unstructured data by interpreting information
compositions known to its type system. These interpretations are then visualised. The type system in its nature is a
weak typed dynamic object model that can be extended easily. To support specialised use cases and allow rapid
development Black Fennec provides an extension api. With the final product one will be capable of visualising and
editing any JSON and YAML files in a more productive way. A close integration of git allows for collaboration and data sharing over existing infrastructure.
