UI/UX Design decisions
====================

Splash screen
***************

A splash screen seems for the average software developer like an insignificant detail with low priority. We see the splash screen as a highly underestimated and powerful tool to boost user experience.

Not only does a software with a splash screen look more complete and professional, it also keeps the user calm.
Users are generally very impatient when firing an action on their device. To prevent users from clicking multiple times on the Black Fennec desktop icon, a splash screen appears to show that the software is starting. Additionally, a progress bar inside the splash screen window tells the user that the software is loading and is not frozen, in case Black Fennec is run on a slow device.

Main window
**************


Window characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Black Fennec window appears in the center of the screen in a fixed size after its run.
This prevents the window from getting lost in case the user has a lot of windows already open.

After the window first appears, it is movable and resizable via the custom window decoration but still has a minimum size.


General appearance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The main UI is kept in a dark mode theme for technical and user experience reasons. Dark mode software can prolong the battery life of devices with OLED or AMOLED displays. Besides battery life, dark mode is, for most people, more comfortable to look at, especially in an environment with low lighting.

Layout
^^^^^^^
To make users adapt easy to the Black Fennec UI, the layout is strongly inspired by modern development tools and follows layout conventions. In Addition, most commonly used functionalities are embedded into the toolbar and can be reached by two clicks max.
