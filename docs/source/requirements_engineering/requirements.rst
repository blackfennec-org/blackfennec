Requirements Engineering
========================
In General we refrain from defining Use Cases in the requirements engineering in this project. We took a more user centered approach and focus our requirements engineering on Epics and User Stories.

Epic Overview
=============
This diagram provides an overview over the epics that our specified personas found under #TODO would like to be able to do with Black Fennec. It is intentionally done in the way of an UML-Diagram Overview but is apart from the format quite different. The personas are not representing specific roles that have to be able to do something but a category of users that have certain needs and expectations.
