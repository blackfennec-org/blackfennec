Requirements Engineering
========================

In General we refrain from defining Use Cases in the requirements engineering in this project. We took a more user centered approach and focus our requirements engineering on Epics and User Stories. Additionally to the functional requirements that are specified in this user centered approach, non-functional requirements are evaluated in a separate document :doc:`non_functional`.

Our user centered approach means, that we created three individual personas that each represent a different user group. These personas can be found :doc:`here <personas>`.

Additionally to the traditional requirements, wireframes of the UI were created to give the viewer an initial understanding of how the application might look like. These can be found in the document :doc:`ui_sketches`
