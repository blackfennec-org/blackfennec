Requirements Engineering
========================

In General we refrain from defining use cases in the requirements engineering in this project. We took a more user centered approach and focus our requirements engineering on epics and user stories. Additionally to the :ref:`functional requirements <functional_requirements>` that are specified in this user centered approach, :ref:`non-functional requirements <non_functional_requirements>` are also evaluated using the ISO 25010 standard as a reference.

Our user centered approach means, that we created three individual personas that each represent a different user group. These personas can be found :ref:`here <personas>`.

Additionally to the traditional requirements, :ref:`wireframes of the UI <ui_sketches>` were created before the start of development to give the viewer an initial understanding of how the application might look like.
