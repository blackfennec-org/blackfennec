Epic Overview
"""""""""""""

This diagram provides an overview over the epics that our specified :ref:`personas` would like to be able to do with Black Fennec. It is intentionally done like an UML diagram overview but is apart from the format quite different. The personas are not representing specific roles that have to be able to do something but a category of users that have certain needs and expectations.

User Stories
""""""""""""

The user epics described in this document can be found in the github repository in the `issue board <https://gitlab.ost.ch/blackfennec/blackfennec/-/boards/>`_ and can be distinguished by their unique formulation which is structured like follows: `As <persona> i want ... so that ...`.

These epics can then be broken down into more detailed parts called user stories if necessary, which are created in the range of sprint plannings or a dedicated backlog-refinement meeting.
