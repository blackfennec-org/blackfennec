Epic Overview
"""""""""""""

This diagram provides an overview over the epics that our specified personas found under :doc:`personas` would like to be able to do with Black Fennec. It is intentionally done in the way of an UML-Diagram Overview but is apart from the format quite different. The personas are not representing specific roles that have to be able to do something but a category of users that have certain needs and expectations.

User Stories
""""""""""""

The user epics described in this document can be found in the github repository under the `epics label <https://gitlab.ost.ch/epj/2021-FS/g01_blackfennec/black-fennec/-/boards/240?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&label_name[]=Epic>`_. These epics are broken down into more detailed parts called user stories which can only be found under the `user story label <https://gitlab.ost.ch/epj/2021-FS/g01_blackfennec/black-fennec/-/boards/240?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&label_name[]=User%20Story>`_ and are not part of this documentation. User stories are created in the range of sprint plannings or a dedicated backlog-refinement meeting and the overarching epics are deleted once all contained user stories are finalised.
