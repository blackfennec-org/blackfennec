In this part of the documentation the project itself is described. This includes the project management, the requirements engineering part and the project standards.

Most of Black Fennec was developed in the scope of two consecutive projects by students of the University of Applied Sciences in Rapperswil (HSR). These two projects including their planning can be found in the :ref:`project management <project_management>` section. Additionally, more general information such as :ref:`design decisions <design_decisions>` or the :ref:`risk analysis <risk_analysis>` are also contained in this section.

The requirements engineering contains the :ref:`functional <functional_requirements>` and :ref:`non-functional requirements <non_functional_requirements>` of the project. The functional requirements are described with an :ref:`epic overview <epic_overview>` and more specific :ref:`user stories <user_stories>` while the :ref:`non-functional requirements <non_functional_requirements>` follow the ISO 25010 standard.

In the :ref:`standards section <project_standards>` the project standards are described. These standards are used to ensure a consistent and high quality code base.
