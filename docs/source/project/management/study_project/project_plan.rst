Project Plan
============

The project plan shows how the project was managed and planned. It has the goal to provide means to evaluate the project management and planning process which was not done formally in the form of a concrete document.

The :ref:`lessons learned <sa_reflection>` from the preceding `engineering project <engineering_project>` influenced this project greatly, as the last project had too much overhead for what was done. Contrary to this project the overhead was expected and intended by the scope of the project. From the taken lessons learned we decided to reduce the overhead by slimming it down, and increasing the duration of a sprint.

The planning was done mainly on the `issue board <https://gitlab.ost.ch/blackfennec/blackfennec/-/boards>`_ in the Gitlab instance. We used labels and milestones to further structure the issues.

We created a `milestone <https://gitlab.ost.ch/blackfennec/blackfennec/-/milestones>`_ for each sprint and assigned the issues to the sprint they were planned for. We decided on sprints of the length of 3 weeks, as this was deemed the optimal length for the project, which turned out to be true.

In the initial planning the backlog was populated with epics that were defined in the `project proposal <project_proposal>`_ as the scope of the project. The assignment of these epics to specific sprints was re-evaluated on a regular basis and the epics were split into smaller issues or sub-tasks if necessary. The issues were then assigned to the sprint they were planned for and to the developer responsible for the implementation.

Additionally to the issues in the form of epics/user stories, we also created issues for tasks or literal issues that were encountered during the course of the project. These issues then functioned as fillers in the sprints where no additional epic would fit but still some time was left.
