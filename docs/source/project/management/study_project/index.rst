Study Project
=============

The `study project <https://studien.rj.ost.ch/allModules/23498_M_SAI.html>`_ is a semester long project that is carried out by a group of two students. Accumulated about 480 hours were invested into the development of Black Fennec. In contrast to the preceding :ref:`engineering project <engineering_project>` only two (compared to four) members had each double the time on the project resulting in the same amount of accumulated work hours.

This project, a student project of the Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences (OST), was supervised by Prof. Mirko Stocker.

The :ref:`project plan <sa_project_plan>` provides a rough overview of our project, the project organization, and the management processes. As this project was a continuation of the :ref:`engineering project <engineering_project>` and only two people developed it, it required significantly less communication overhead. In the previous project the Scrum process was identified as too much overhead and was as such not very suitable for a project of this size. Most of our planning was done inside of the issue board of our projects repository. Formally documenting this process here would have been - in our eyes - of lesser value to the intended target audience (future developers) then extending the documentation in other more valuable sections.

To provide an overview of what was achieved over the course of this project an :ref:`increment` in the form of a change overview from the version 0.6 - which was the version from before this project - and the final release was created.

Additionally to the aforementioned subsections this section also contains the projects :ref:`time tracking <sa_time_tracking>` and a :ref:`reflection statement <sa_reflection>` that was written at the end of the project.

An overview of all the mentioned subsections can be found in the following table of contents:
