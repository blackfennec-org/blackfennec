Supervisor
""""""""""

This student research project is supervised by Prof. Mirko Stocker, mirko.stocker@ost.ch. This assignment is based on the guidelines for bachelor and student theses of the computer science program.

Students
""""""""

This work is carried out as a student research project at the department of computer science by the following students:

* Caspar Martens
* Simon Kindhauser

Introduction
""""""""""""

The idea for Black Fennec arose from the need for a tool that can assist in the collection of any data. Black Fennec is positioned between Microsoft Word and Microsoft Access and is intended to compete with their use for the purpose of data collection. It can be understood as a just-in-time form generator or data store.

With the semi-structured approach, we are able to offer manipulation and display possibilities that would not be possible with continuous text or classic databases.

The current version supports basic functionalities like editing and creating datasets. These data sets can be processed in JSON format. Great importance was attached to the extensibility and so a plug-in system allows the addition and removal of data types at runtime.

Goals
"""""

The goal of the work is primarily the publication of Black Fennec as a product. For this purpose the project shall be brought into a stable and maintainable state, the architecture and the code shall be critically reviewed and improved and a number of not yet existing functionalities shall be added.

In the spirit of agile project planning, the following epics are part of the backlog

* Reduction of technical debt

    * Architecture refactoring
    * JsonPointer
    * File caching and saving
    * Program settings
    * Plugin system

* New features

    * Stable templating API
    * YAML support
    * Actions
    * GTK4
    * JsonPath
    * XML support
    * Collaboration
    * Plugins

        * Base
        * OSINT
        * GeoJson
        * Graph Presenter

The exact features are defined by the team during the project work. The work is planned as four three-week sprints, which always produce a deliverable product at the end. In the last sprint we focus on the public publication of the project (Gitlab/Github, publication on Flathub, website).

Realization
"""""""""""

The course work is about applying the knowledge you have learned in the various modules of OST to a project. In particular, your software engineering skills will be required. You will be expected to apply this knowledge and use methods such as unit testing, clean code, SCM and continuous integration whenever possible.

Meetings with the supervisor or client will be held once or twice a week, the exact rotation will be mutually agreed upon at the beginning of the work. Additional meetings are to be arranged by the student as needed.

All meetings, except the kick-off meeting, are to be attended by the students with an agenda. (What was done? What was accomplished? What was not? What questions do we have?). As a rule, a meeting should not exceed one hour. The agenda should be sent to the meeting participants at least half a working day in advance. The results of the meetings (i.e. the decisions made) are to be recorded by the students and then sent to the supervisor or stored in a defined place (e.g. wiki).

Tools
"""""

Unless specified in the assignment, students are responsible for selecting their own tools, libraries, frameworks, SaaS offerings, etc. If desired, a virtual machine hosted at OST can be provided.

Evaluation
""""""""""

Successful coursework counts for 8 ECTS points per student. For 1 ECTS point is a work performance of 30 hours. The responsible lecturer is responsible for the assessment.

=================================== ==============================
 Aspect                              Weight
=================================== ==============================
 Organisation, realization           20 %
 Formal quality of the report        20 %
 Analysis, design and evaluation     20 %
 Technical implementation            40 %
=================================== ==============================

The grade is announced to the students via unterricht.rj.ost.ch. The lecturer can/may indicate whether the work is considered pass/fail, he/she may also give advance warning if there is a risk of an unsatisfactory grade.
