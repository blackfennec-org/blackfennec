Engineering Project
===================

The `engineering project <https://studien.rj.ost.ch/allModules/25619_M_EPJ.html>`_ is a semester long project that is carried out by a group of students. In the context of this project an accumulated 480 hours were invested into the development of Black Fennec.

Contrary to the usual way of selecting a predefined topic that is given by a lecturer, the students came up with the idea for Black Fennec. This was done via a :ref:`project proposal <project_proposal>` and guided by Thomas KÃ¤lin, lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil who supervised the project.

The :ref:`project plan <epj_project_plan>` was created at the beginning of the project and provides a rough overview of our project, the project organization, and the management processes. The plan was updated regularly during the project. Additionally to this plan another artifact created was during/after the :ref:`elaboration phase <elaboration>` of the project and highlights the most important decisions made during this phase and contains a detailed plan for the succeeding :ref:`construction phase <construction_phase_plan>`.

The :ref:`refinement document <refinement>` contains suggestions for improvement, that were received, and how they were addressed. Additionally to that this section also contains the projects :ref:`time tracking <time_tracking>` and a :ref:`reflection statement <epj_reflection>` that was written at the end of the project.

An overview of all the mentioned subsections can be found in the following table of contents:
