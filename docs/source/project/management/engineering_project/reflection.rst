Reflection
==========

The engineering project is coming to an end. We experienced this project as a tightly coupled team,
which is why, besides duplicate «code», we decided to write the reflection on our work in a team
effort. We have learned many new things, and reinforced many things that we knew only from a
theoretical perspective.

Two modules that gave us the theoretical basis on this project were Software Engineering 1 & 2, in
which we did not yet have a real practical experience to test the learned techniques. One of the
things learned in SE1, the usage of git, was not totally clear for all of us at the beginning of the
project, but over a short period of time, became completely logical. But much more important where
the project management practices such as SCRUM/agile, which we strictly followed during the whole
project. We noticed that planning a project is alot of work, and comes with a certain overhead. The
time spent planning and creating documentation of the planning took much more time than
anticipated. Nearly a third of the time we would have ususally spent programming was invested into
planning and reviewing our processes. But nevertheless the planning provided us with a guidance
that was very useful to ensure the quality and timeliness of our project.

Technologically we have also learned many new things. For example the programming language
python was newly learned by three of the four team members. This goes from simple things, for
example structural typing to more advanced disciplines such as testing, linting, CI-CD, etc. Another
totally new technology learned for all of us was the GUI-Framework GTK, with which we built our
application. Regarding the documentation, which we decided to set up on our own, was also
managed with a new tool called Sphinx. Eventhough we did not know how to use these technologies
at the beginning, we began to understand them without much effort, as the concepts behind them
did not differ significantly from other programming languages, frameworks or documentation
engines we already knew. This leaves us with the conclusion, that as long as you understand the core
concepts learning new things based on these concepts is quite easy.

Because we are very pleased with our work and the code quality produced we are looking forward to
work with this project as a foundation for future projects building up upon black-fennec. We plan to
release this project into open source soon, and will then work on further improvements and features
in our free time or maybe even in a semester project or bachelor thesis.

We had alot of fun during this project and learned many new things, and if we had to do it all over
again, the path we would take would only differ marginally.
