Project Management
==================

This section contains the two projects which make up most of the initial contributions to Black Fennec. Additionally, you will find an overview of key :ref:`design decisions <design_decisions>` and a detailed :ref:`risk analysis <risk_analysis>` which have inter-project significance. 

The first project is called the :ref:`engineering project <engineering_project>` and is a student project of the University of Applied Sciences in Rapperswil (HSR).
In it four developers cumulatively invested approximately 480 hours of work. It laid the groundwork for the project and was the first step towards a fully functional application.

The second project called :ref:`study project <study_project>` is also a student project of the Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences (OST). It is a continuation of the engineering project and has two developers also cumulatively investing approximately 480 hours of work. It's main goal is the release of Version 1.0 of Black Fennec in a stable and mature manner.
