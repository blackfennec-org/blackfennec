Project Plan
============

Introduction
************

Objective
---------
| Black Fennec is a tool that serves as a sharable information structuring assistance.
|
| A main application we see in OSINT gathering and the storage of the discovered data.
| With certain plugins also for the automated search of data.

Project Overview
****************
Black Fennec is going to be an application that is able to manage unstructured data by interpreting information compositions known to its type system. These interpretations are then visualised. The type system in its nature is a weak typed dynamic object model that can be extended easily. To support specialised use cases and allow rapid development Black Fennec provides an extension api. With the final product one will be capable of visualising and editing any JSON and YAML files in a more productive way. A close integration of git allows for collaboration and data sharing over existing infrastructure.

Purpose & Objectives
--------------------
The Objective is to have a usable product for data management in our toolset that can be maintained and enhanced for an extended period of time. Therefore the quality of our architecture is of utmost importance.

We will use Black Fennec mainly as a data editing and visualisation tool that allows us to collaborate.

Our hopes are that the project will inspire a community to develop extensions and find use cases that we currently cant envision. For this we intend to release our sourcecode into the public domain.

To address our personal goals, we intend to utilise and reinforce the knowledge gained during our studies. Simultaneously we hope to learn many new principles and patterns.

Assumptions & Limitations
--------------------------
We expect to accomplish our core objectives before the delivery date. If time permits we will implement further extensions which add additional use cases. These extensions are not part of the engineering project but could be featured in the presentation to show the extensibility and usability of the project.
