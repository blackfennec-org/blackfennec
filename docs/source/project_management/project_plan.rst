Project Plan
============

Introduction
************

Objective
---------
The purpose of this document is to describe the project plan and provide an overview of the Black-Fennec project.
This document contains a rough overview of our project, the project organization, and management processes.
It also includes risk management and some brief information about the infrastructure.

The project plan serves as a basis for the upcoming documents.

Scope
-----
The scope of this project is limited to the duration of the module Engineering Project FS2021.

Project Overview
****************
Black Fennec is going to be an application that is able to manage unstructured data by interpreting information
compositions known to its type system. These interpretations are then visualised. The type system in its nature is a
weak typed dynamic object model that can be extended easily. To support specialised use cases and allow rapid
development Black Fennec provides an extension api. With the final product one will be capable of visualising and
editing any JSON and YAML files in a more productive way. A close integration of git allows for collaboration and data
sharing over existing infrastructure.

Purpose & Objectives
--------------------
The Objective is to have a usable product for data management in our toolset that can be maintained and enhanced for an
extended period of time. Therefore the quality of our architecture is of utmost importance.

We will use Black Fennec mainly as a data editing and visualisation tool that allows us to collaborate.

Our hopes are that the project will inspire a community to develop extensions and find use cases that we currently cant
envision. For this we intend to release our sourcecode into the public domain.

To address our personal goals, we intend to utilise and reinforce the knowledge gained during our studies.
Simultaneously we hope to learn many new principles and patterns.

Assumptions & Limitations
-------------------------
We expect to accomplish our core objectives before the delivery date. If time permits we will implement further
extensions which add additional use cases. These extensions are not part of the engineering project but could be
featured in the presentation to show the extensibility and usability of the project.

Project Organisation
********************

Organisational Structure
------------------------
To manage our project we use scrum roles and additionally assigned competences to each member.

Time Management
---------------
We use Gitlab to track the time estimated and spent time of our work items represented as issues. For fine grained
time management will be conducted before each sprint (lasting two weeks).
