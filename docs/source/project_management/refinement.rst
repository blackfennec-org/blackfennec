Refinement
**********
After each sprint, a review meeting was held to discuss the current status of the project. The checklist of the individual milestones was discussed and it was ensured that all items on the list were fulfilled. During the meetings, we received some suggestions for improvement from our supervisor, which we implemented during the course of the project.

This document provides an overview of all these improvement suggestions and how they were implemented in our project.

Project Plan
============

Improvements
------------

**Role Project Lead / Project Manager must be added in the documentation**
The description of this role was added in the document :ref:`project plan <Project Organisation>`

**Rough plan of the project must be created and added in the documentation**
We created a project timeline in the document :ref:`project plan <Project Timeline>`

**Add the time needed to respond to the risk to the risk analysis and the rough plan of the project**
The time needed to respond to a risk is included in the project timeline.

Requirements Engineering & Domainanalysis
=========================================

Improvements
------------
**Explain the rhombus sign in the domain model with pseudocode**


**Prioritize the important non-functional requirements**


**Use the personas in the use-cases**
We did this by relating the user stories to specific personas. An example of this can be found :ref:`here. <https://gitlab.ost.ch/epj/2021-FS/g01_blackfennec/black-fennec/-/issues/131>`_

**Add sketches from extensions as soon as they exist**


Architecture Prototype & End of Elaboration
===========================================

Improvements
------------
**It is hard to make a connection between the architecture documentation and our structure in the code. We should therefore consider either adapting the documentation or the folder structure**


**Mention in the documentation that in our project everything is done in a process and we do not have a backend**


**The diagram of the architecture and source documentation should be matched to each other**


**Consider changing the title 'Documentation'**

Software Architecture
=====================

Improvements
------------
**Consider adding a performance test. E.g. insertion of large files**


**The document contains only static views of the system. Consider adding a dynamic view of the system**


Quality Ensurance Measurements & Code Quality
=============================================

Improvements
------------

**Consider adding usability tests**
