Overlay
=======
The overlay is usually the layer above the :ref:`underlay <definition_underlay>`. It is a processed view of the underlay. References are resolved and do not exist on this layer. This layer is more easily :ref:`interpreted <definition_interpretation>` and is the default layer presented to the user.
