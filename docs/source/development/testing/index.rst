To ensure the stability, usability, and functional correctness of the system, we deploy numerous testing strategies including usability, system, integration, and unit tests. The unit and integration test are written in Python and executed with the pytest framework during the CI/CD pipeline whilst the usability tests are conducted manually on every major an minor release. The usability tests are conducted after every major release.

The pages below document the results of the different manually conducted tests.
