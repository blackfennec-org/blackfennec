Black Fennec is in essence a glorified JSON viewer which allows the implementation of custom views that ought to better represent the underlining data.

This part of the documentation is exclusively about the most important artefact, the software itself. Here you can find what was actually implemented and how. This is in contrast to standards, requirements and management documentation.

Checkout the :ref:`architecture` or the :ref:`domain_model` to learn more about the conceptual inner-workings, or enjoy the :doc:`generated documentation <code/modules>` of the code itself.
